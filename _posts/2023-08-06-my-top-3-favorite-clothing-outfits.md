# My Top 3 Favorite Clothing Outfits

![](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413150/capsule_616x353.jpg)

## Welcome

These are my 3 favorite pieces of clothing that I like. I like them because they look cool or I just like them. You will learn how to make all the outfits in this post. I hope you enjoy this to your heart's greatest desire.

## 1. Dinosaur outfit

You will look like a dinosaur with 6 eyes.

- Dinosaur hat = cloth + dinosaur egg
- Slime shirt = cloth + petrified slime
- dinosaur pants = cloth + dinosaur mayonnaise

Other notes:
If you don't have petrified slime you can just use slime to make a green shirt

## 2. Prismatic Outfit

You will look shiny and colorful/prismaticful.

- Prismatic cowboy hat = desert trader with 333 omni geode only odd calendar days
- Prismatic shirt = cloth + prismatic shard
- Prismatic pants = cloth + prismatic shard

Other notes:
For the pants and the shirt, it's random

## 3. Witch outfit

You will look like a witch.

- Witch hat = cloth + golden pumpkin
- Black shirt
- Black pants or skirt

## Bye

Hey, what's your favorite outfit? Or what cool outfits can you come up with?
